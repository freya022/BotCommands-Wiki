# Creating slash commands

Slash commands are the new way of defining commands, even though there are limitations with them, 
we do have some advantages such as being easier to fill in, choices and auto-completion.

!!! info "If you wish to handle application commands yourself, you can disable them by disabling [[BApplicationConfigBuilder#enable]]."

## Defining the command method

!!! tip
    Make sure you read the [common command requirements](../common-command-details.md#defining-the-command-method) first!

In addition to the common requirements, the first parameter must be `GlobalSlashEvent` for global commands
or `GuildSlashEvent` for guild commands, or guild-only global commands (default).

## Slash command properties
Annotated and code-declared slash commands share the same properties, however,
annotated commands will require an annotation for each command "level" (layer if you prefer)
to prevent confusion.

For example, on a `/ban temp users` command, you can set the description for all of these levels with:

- [[JDASlashCommand#description]]: Sets the description of `/ban temp users`
- [[SlashCommandGroupData#description]]: Sets the description of `/ban temp`
- [[TopLevelSlashCommandData#description]]: Sets the description of `/ban`

### Notable top-level properties
- [`scope`][[TopLevelSlashCommandData#scope]]: Where the command is pushed, either once globally, or on each guild.
  Guild commands have extra capabilities, such as allowing its declaration on a per-guild basis,
  pushing it to test guilds, or having per-guild choices.
- [`contexts`][[TopLevelSlashCommandData#contexts]]: Where the command can be used, can be used for user-installable commands
- [`integrationTypes`][[TopLevelSlashCommandData#integrationTypes]]: Where the command can be installed, can be used for user-installable commands
- [`description`][[TopLevelSlashCommandData#description]]: The command description, remind that it applies only on the top-level command
- [`defaultLocked`][[TopLevelSlashCommandData#defaultLocked]]: Locks the commands to administrators until further configuration from them

## Annotated commands

Annotated command methods must be annotated with `#!java @JDASlashCommand`,
where you can set the scope, name, description, etc..., 
while the declaring class must extend `ApplicationCommand`.

!!! question "Why do I need to extend `ApplicationCommand`?"

    As a limitation of annotated commands, 
    you are required to extend this class as it allows the framework to ask your commands for stuff,
    like what guilds a command should be pushed to, getting a value generator for one of their options,
    and also getting choices.

[//]: # (TODO add tip with live template)

!!! example
    === "Kotlin"
        ```kotlin
        --8<-- "wiki/commands/slash/SlashPing.kt:ping-kotlin"
        ```

    === "Java"
        ```java
        --8<-- "wiki/java/commands/slash/SlashPing.java:ping-java"
        ```

### Top level configuration
You can configure properties which only applies to top-level commands, using [[TopLevelSlashCommandData]],
this includes elements such as the `scope` (guild, global or global without DMs), `description` and whether the command is locked to admins by default.

### Subcommands

To make a subcommand, set the `name` and `subcommand` on the annotation.

You will also need to add a [[TopLevelSlashCommandData]],
it must only be used **once per top-level** command, this allows you to set top-level attributes.

!!! example

    === "Kotlin"
        ```kotlin
        --8<-- "wiki/commands/slash/SlashTag.kt:slash_subcommands-kotlin"
        ```

    === "Java"
        ```java
        --8<-- "wiki/java/commands/slash/SlashTag.java:slash_subcommands-java"
        ```

!!! note

    You cannot have both subcommands and top-level commands (i.e., an annotation with only `name` set).

    However, you can have both subcommand groups and subcommands groups containing subcommands.

### Adding options

Options can be added with a parameter annotated with `#!java @SlashOption`.

All supported types are documented under `ParameterResolver`, and [other types can be added](option-resolvers.md).

!!! example
    === "Kotlin"
        ```kotlin
        --8<-- "wiki/commands/slash/SlashSay.kt:say-kotlin"
        ```

    === "Java"
        ```java
        --8<-- "wiki/java/commands/slash/SlashSay.java:say-java"
        ```

!!! tip "Inferred option names"
    Display names of options can be set on the annotation,
    but can also be deduced from the parameter name, this is natively supported in Kotlin,
    but for Java, you will need to [enable parameter names](../../using-botcommands/parameter-names.md) on the Java compiler.

#### Using choices

You must override `getOptionChoices` in order to return a list of choices, 
be careful to check against the command path as well as the option's display name.

!!! example
    === "Kotlin"
        ```kotlin
        --8<-- "wiki/commands/slash/SlashConvert.kt:convert-kotlin"
        ```

    === "Java"
        ```java
        --8<-- "wiki/java/commands/slash/SlashConvert.java:convert-java"
        ```

    As you can see, despite the short choice list, 
    the method is quite lengthy and causes duplications with multiple commands.
    This issue is solved with [predefined choices](#using-predefined-choices).

#### Using autocomplete

!!! info "Learn how to create an autocomplete handler [here](using-autocomplete.md)"

Enabling autocompletion for an option is done by referencing an existing handler,
in the [`autocomplete`][[SlashOption#autocomplete]] property of your [[SlashOption]].

!!! example

    Using the autocomplete handler we made ["Creating autocomplete handlers"](using-autocomplete.md):

    === "Kotlin"
        ```kotlin
        --8<-- "wiki/commands/slash/SlashWord.kt:word_command-kotlin"
        ```

    === "Java"
        ```java
        --8<-- "wiki/java/commands/slash/SlashWord.java:word_command-java"
        ```

### Generated values

Generated values are parameters that get their values from a lambda everytime a command is run.

You must give one by overriding [[ApplicationCommand#getGeneratedValueSupplier]], 
similarly to adding choices.

As always, make sure to check against the command path as well as the option's display name.

!!! example
    === "Kotlin"
        ```kotlin
        --8<-- "wiki/commands/slash/SlashCreateTime.kt:create_time-kotlin"
        ```

    === "Java"
        ```java
        --8<-- "wiki/java/commands/slash/SlashCreateTime.java:create_time-java"
        ```

### Rate limiting
This lets you reject application commands if the user tries to use them too often.

#### Using an (anonymous) rate limiter
Use [[RateLimit]] or [[Cooldown]] to define one on an application command.

=== "Kotlin"
    ```kotlin
    --8<-- "wiki/commands/slash/SlashRateLimit.kt:rate_limit-kotlin"
    ```

=== "Java"
    ```java
    --8<-- "wiki/java/commands/slash/SlashRateLimit.java:rate_limit-java"
    ```

#### Using an existing rate limiter
Nothing as simple as using [[RateLimitReference]] with the `group` of a rate limiter defined in a `RateLimitProvider`.

!!! info "Learn how to create a rate limiter with ["Defining a rate limit"](../../using-botcommands/ratelimit.md)"

=== "Kotlin"
    ```kotlin
    --8<-- "wiki/ratelimit/WikiRateLimitProvider.kt:rate_limit_provider-kotlin"
    ```

    ```kotlin
    --8<-- "wiki/commands/slash/SlashRateLimitExisting.kt:rate_limit_existing-kotlin"
    ```

=== "Java"
    ```java
    --8<-- "wiki/java/ratelimit/WikiRateLimitProvider.java:rate_limit_provider-java"
    ```

    ```java
    --8<-- "wiki/java/commands/slash/SlashRateLimitExisting.java:rate_limit_existing-java"
    ```

#### Cooldown
A cooldown is a rate limit, but with fewer parameters, it can be used as `#!java @Cooldown(5, ChronoUnit.SECONDS /* also scope and deleteOnRefill */)`.

### Filtering commands
You can use [[DeclarationFilter]] if you wish to declare a **guild** command conditionally.

!!! note

    There is no equivalent for DSL commands as you can check and return early with your own code.

#### Creating the filter
Create a service implementing [[CommandDeclarationFilter]],
and make the method return `true` if the command can be declared.
All filters must return `true` for the command to be declared.

!!! example

    === "Kotlin"
        ```kotlin
        --8<-- "wiki/filters/declaration/BotOwnerIsGuildOwnerDeclarationFilter.kt:command_declaration_filter-kotlin"
        ```
    
    === "Java"
        ```java
        --8<-- "wiki/java/filters/declaration/BotOwnerIsGuildOwnerDeclarationFilter.java:command_declaration_filter-java"
        ```

#### Using the filter
Add a [[DeclarationFilter]] on your command and reference your filter inside it.

!!! example

    === "Kotlin"
        ```kotlin
        --8<-- "wiki/commands/slash/SlashBotOwnerIsGuildOwner.kt:declaration_filter-kotlin"
        ```
    
    === "Java"
        ```java
        --8<-- "wiki/java/commands/slash/SlashBotOwnerIsGuildOwner.java:declaration_filter-java"
        ```

## DSL commands (Kotlin)

Commands can be DSL-declared by either implementing:

- [[GlobalApplicationCommandProvider]] (for global / guild-only global application commands), or,
- [[GuildApplicationCommandProvider]] (for guild-specific application commands)

You can then use the `slashCommand` method on the `manager`, give it the command name, the command method, 
and then configure your command.

!!! tip
    You are allowed to not add any command at all, for example, 
    if the `guild` in `GuildApplicationCommandManager` isn't a guild you want the command to appear in.

!!! example
    ```kotlin
    --8<-- "wiki/commands/slash/SlashPing.kt:ping-kotlin_dsl"
    ```

### Subcommands

As top-level commands cannot be made alongside subcommands, the top-level `function` must be `null`.

You can then add a subcommand by using `subcommand`, where each subcommand is its own function.

!!! example
    ```kotlin
    --8<-- "wiki/commands/slash/SlashTag.kt:slash_subcommands-kotlin_dsl"
    ```

!!! info
    
    You can still create both subcommands, and subcommand groups containg subcommands.

### Adding options

Options can be added with a parameter and declaring it using `option` in your command builder,
where the `declaredName` is the name of your parameter, the block will let you change the description, choices, etc.

All supported types are documented under [[ParameterResolver]], and [other types can be added](option-resolvers.md).

!!! example
    ```kotlin
    --8<-- "wiki/commands/slash/SlashSay.kt:say-kotlin_dsl"
    ```

!!! tip
    You can override the option name by setting `optionName` in the option declaration:
    ```kotlin
    option("content", optionName = "sentence") {
        ...
    }
    ```

#### Using choices

Adding choices is very straight forward, you only have to give a list of choices to the `choice` property.

!!! example
    ```kotlin
    --8<-- "wiki/commands/slash/SlashConvert.kt:convert-kotlin_dsl"
    ```

    As you can see, despite the short choice list, this causes duplications with multiple commands.
    This issue is solved with [predefined choices](#using-predefined-choices).

#### Using autocomplete

!!! info "Learn how to create an autocomplete handler [here](using-autocomplete.md)"

Enabling autocompletion for an option is done by referencing an existing handler,
either using [`autocompleteByFunction`][[SlashCommandOptionBuilder#autocompleteByFunction]] or [`autocompleteByName`][[SlashCommandOptionBuilder#autocompleteByName]].

!!! tip

    I recommend using `autocompleteByFunction` as it avoids typing the name twice.

!!! example

    Using the autocomplete handler we made ["Creating autocomplete handlers"](using-autocomplete.md#__tabbed_1_1):

    ```kotlin
    --8<-- "wiki/commands/slash/SlashWord.kt:word_command-kotlin_dsl"
    ```

### Rate limiting
This lets you reject application commands if the user tries to use them too often.

!!! info "Learn how to create a rate limiter with ["Defining a rate limit"](../../using-botcommands/ratelimit.md)"

#### Using an (anonymous) rate limiter
```kotlin
--8<-- "wiki/commands/slash/SlashRateLimitDsl.kt:rate_limit-kotlin_dsl"
```

#### Using an existing rate limiter
Nothing as simple as using `rateLimitReference` with the `group` of a rate limiter defined in a [[RateLimitProvider]].

```kotlin
--8<-- "wiki/ratelimit/WikiRateLimitProvider.kt:rate_limit_provider-kotlin"
```

```kotlin
--8<-- "wiki/commands/slash/SlashRateLimitExistingDsl.kt:rate_limit_existing-kotlin_dsl"
```

#### Cooldown
A cooldown is a rate limit, but with fewer parameters, it can be used as `cooldown(5.seconds /* also scope and deleteOnRefill */)`.

### Generated values

Generated values are a command parameter that gets their values computed by the given block everytime the command run.

Contrary to the annotated commands, no checks are required, as this is tied to the currently built command.

!!! example
    ```kotlin
    --8<-- "wiki/commands/slash/SlashCreateTime.kt:create_time-kotlin_dsl"
    ```

## Default description

You can avoid setting the (non-localized) descriptions of your commands and options 
by putting them in a localization file, using the root locale (i.e., no locale suffix),
for more details, see ["Localizing application commands"](../../using-botcommands/localization/commands.md).

## Using predefined choices

If your choices stay the same for every command,
you can improve re-usability and avoid extra code by using choices on the resolver's level,
that is, the resolver will return the choices used for every option of their type.

All you now need to do is enable `usePredefinedChoices` on your option.

!!! example
    Here, the resolver for `TimeUnit` is already defined and will be explained in [Adding option resolvers](option-resolvers.md).

    === "Kotlin"
        ```kotlin
        --8<-- "wiki/commands/slash/SlashConvertSimplified.kt:convert_simplified-kotlin"
        ```

    === "Kotlin (DSL)"
        ```kotlin
        --8<-- "wiki/commands/slash/SlashConvertSimplified.kt:convert_simplified-kotlin_dsl"
        ```

    === "Java"
        ```java
        --8<-- "wiki/java/commands/slash/SlashConvertSimplified.java:convert_simplified-java"
        ```

## Update logs

You can optionally get more info on what changed in your application commands,
by enabling the `TRACE` logs on `io.github.freya022.botcommands.internal.commands.application.diff.DiffLogger`,
or any package it is in.
